Looking at a data reporting about accidental death due to drug abuse/misuse between 2012 and 2017 in Connecticut.

 According to UN World Drug Report of 2021, drugs like Cannabis and Opiods` use are on the increase and only a few of the young people see it as being harmful.

These practice results into drug abuse/misuse and thereby leading to grave consequences such as addiction, intoxication and later death.

Looking at a data reporting about accidental death due to drug abuse/misuse between 2012 and 2017 in Connecticut. Can we say the abusers/misusers do not understand the effect/severity of their actions, as they might not be able to make it to the hospital before they die in the case of a drug intoxication?

If they are able to arrive at the hospital on time in the case of an intoxication, there are chances of survival. Is this abuse/misuse peculiar to a particular gender and age group? What age group is the most affected by this practice?
